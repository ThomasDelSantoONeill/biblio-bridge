  "title": "Mixed-fishery or ecosystem conundrum? Multispecies considerations inform thinking on long-term management of North Sea demersal stocks",
  "abstract": "Signatories of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development declaration committed to maintain or restore fish stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), a goal that has been challenged on a number of grounds. The European Commission has stated an objective to manage fisheries (independently) to achieve MSY by 2015, which has catalysed the Regional Advisory Councilsâ€™ (RACs) thinking on MSY and how it relates to their goal of developing long-term management plans. This study uses an ecosystem model of the North Sea to investigate questions relating to MSY in the context of mixed demersal fisheries for cod, haddock, and whiting. Results suggest that it is not possible to simultaneously achieve yields corresponding to MSYs predicted from single-species assessments and that the contradictory response of whiting is central to the trade-offs in yield and value for mixed demersal fisheries. Incompatibility between mixed-fishery and ecosystem-scale considerations exemplifies the difficult conceptual and practical challenges faced when moving toward an ecosystem approach.",
