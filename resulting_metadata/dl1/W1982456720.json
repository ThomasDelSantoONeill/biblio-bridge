  "title": "North Atlantic Fishery Management Systems: A Comparison of Management Methods and Resource Trends",
  "abstract": "The administrative and regulatory frameworks used to control fishing in each North Atlantic management regime subsequent to declarations of 200 mile limits are documented, and compared to those of the previous international commissions.The apparent objectives underlying regulatory actions are examined, and trends in stocks of the most important finfish species before and after extensions of jurisdiction are described.The primary elements of these regulatory regimes are then compared.In general, management authorities did not develop coherent policies that reconciled conflicting social and economic aspirations and, as a result, in the 1980s most fleets were overcapitalized, exploitation rates were high for most of the important groundfish stocks, enforcement of regulations was difficult, and non-compliance was a serious problem in many regimes.Most regimes have adopted new regulatory approaches in the 1990s.",
