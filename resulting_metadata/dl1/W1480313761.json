  "title": "The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity: Ecological and Economic Foundations",
  "abstract": "Essentially this is a giant review of the environmental economics literature, notable principally for how well it has been promoted.It contains a large compendium of individual studies in the form of a set of appendices, and it is the specific monetary values from these which have received by far the most media attention.The bulk of this volume, however, focuses more on methodological issues.There are seven chapters.The first introduces the overall framework.The second reviews ecosystem services; the third addresses biophysical indicators; and the fourth provides a sociocultural context.The fifth reviews economic valuation approaches; the sixth looks at discounting options; and the seventh examines policy implications.There are 85 authors and 39 reviewers, including some very well-known environmental economists.According to the Preface, the study arose from a meeting of 13 environment ministers in 2007, inspired by the Stern Review on the economics of climate change.The theme is that society is changing, and that knowledge, economics, valuation and accounting must change accordingly, so as to mainstream the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity into national and international policies.",
