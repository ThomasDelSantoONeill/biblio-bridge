  "title": "Competitive Interactions in Ecosystems",
  "abstract": "An analysis was made of the indirect interactions between competing consumers. Two mechanisms for such interactions were investigated, interactions between the resource species and competition from a third consumer species. In both cases it was shown that the overall interaction between the consumers could be beneficial to both and that interaction between the species does not depend on direct niche overlap.",
