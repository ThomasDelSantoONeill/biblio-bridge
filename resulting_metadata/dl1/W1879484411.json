  "title": "Putting a Price Tag on Nature's Bounty",
  "abstract": "How much is the world worth? A group of conservation-minded ecologists and economists has attempted to answer that question —bringing intangibles such as a livable environment into the world of economic costs and benefits—by putting a price tag on the \"ecosystem services\" daily provided pro bono by Mother Nature. Their ambitious appraisal covers environmental resources such as fresh water and soil, as well as processes such as climate regulation, crop pollination, and biological pest control. And their best estimate is that replacing these goods and services would cost $33 trillion per year—nearly twice the combined gross domestic product (GDP) of Earth's 194 nations.",
