  "title": "ISSUES IN MULTISPECIES MODELS",
  "abstract": "ABSTRACT. It is generally acknowledged that models of population dynamics need to include realistic biological and statistical assumptions if they are to be of any use. The “realistic” complexity of these models is defined not only by the underlying biology but also by what the available data can reasonably determine. As complexity increases through inclusion of interactions, new issues arise which need to be resolved before these complex models can be reliably applied. Specific issues in new models for management include proper statistical fitting to the data and incorporation of time‐dependent and spatially explicit biological interactions. These current problem issues are presented in this paper and some potential solutions are discussed.",
