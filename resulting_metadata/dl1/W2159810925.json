  "title": "THE IMPORTANCE OF MEIOFAUNA IN FOOD WEBS: EVIDENCE FROM AN ACID STREAM",
  "abstract": "Seasonal food webs were constructed for the whole invertebrate assemblage (meio- and macrofauna) inhabiting Broadstone Stream (southeast England). High and uniform taxonomic resolution was applied in a dietary analysis, by resolving the complete benthic community to species, including the meiofauna, protozoa, and algae. Meiofauna accounted for 70% of all species in the summary web and for 73% and 63% of those in the summer/autumn and spring webs, respectively. The web structure changed between summer/autumn and winter/spring, due to differences in species composition. Many stream invertebrates fed on meiofauna and organic matter. Addition of meiofauna to the Broadstone web increased the percentage of intermediate species. Seasonal webs contained between 54 (spring 1997) and 86 (autumn 1996) interactive taxa and 229–378 trophic links. Marked differences in web complexity were found between the summer/autumn and winter/spring periods. Meiofauna accounted for most of the links in the web with a high proportion of intermediate–intermediate links in summer and autumn (0.421–0.440) and also of intermediate–basal links during winter and spring (0.509–0.628). In general, the summary web showed that intermediate species and basal resources were numerically dominant components in this stream. Web connectance rose slightly between summer (0.052) and winter (0.061) and increased further in spring (0.079), coinciding with a reduction in species number. A high fraction of detritivores was combined with omnivorous predators, many of which supplemented their diets with organic matter and, depending on season, with algae and invertebrate eggs. In addition, a wide range of feeding modes was found among meiofaunal species. The diversity of the Broadstone community suggests that the impact of top predators tends to dissipate. A low proportion of top predators in the web was combined with a low mean number of prey items, other than detritus, in their guts (large predators, 1.08–1.26 prey/individual gut; small-sized tanypods, 2.15–2.32 prey/individual gut). Dietary similarity was highest in autumn and winter 1996, and observed feeding links of the most common predatory species showed low overlap in their diets. The web architecture of this stream is reticulate and complex, and the patterns observed in these seasonal webs differed from previous stream webs, resulting in low connectance, high linkage density, long food chains, and a high proportion of intermediate species and of intermediate–intermediate links. The food web derived from Broadstone Stream clearly demonstrates that the meiofauna increases web complexity and thus, taking into account their functional diversity, may be crucial to the understanding of food web properties and ecosystems processes in streams.",
