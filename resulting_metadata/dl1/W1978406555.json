  "title": "Relationship of Fishing Mortality to Natural Mortality and Growth at the Level of Maximum Sustainable Yield",
  "abstract": "Fishing mortality constraints are derived for fishes harvested at the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) determined by a delay-difference population model. Those constraints depend upon rates of natural mortality and growth as well as a simple constraint placed on abundance of the exploited population. The results are generalized for a wider class of population models where it is shown that MSY fishing mortality is constrained often to be less than the fishing mortality which maximizes yield per recruit. Fishing mortality rates are lower in the delay difference model in comparison to MSY fishing rates in the logistic model, when a quadratic spawnerâ€“recruit curve is applied.Key words: delay-difference model, logistic model, fishing mortality, maximum sustainable yield, yield per recruit",
