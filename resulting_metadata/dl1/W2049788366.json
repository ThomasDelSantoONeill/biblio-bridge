  "title": "Use of a Mixed-Species Yield-per-Recruit Model to Explore the Consequences of Various Management Policies for the Oregon Flatfish Fishery",
  "abstract": "A mixed-species yield-per-recruit model is developed for a portion of the Oregon flatfish fishery. The model is applied to examine the effects of implementing various management policies on fishery yield in weight and revenues for Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission Area 2B. Three types of management policies are considered: maximization of output, efficiency-oriented, and a minimum trawl cod-end mesh size regulation with no restriction of effort. If an efficiency-oriented policy were adopted, the current minimum mesh size regulation of 114 mm would be optimal. However, if effort is left unrestricted, or if a maximization strategy were adopted, a larger mesh size would result in greater volume yields. Optimal mesh size is more sensitive to the management policy selected than it is to either variations in recruitment or to costs associated with fishing. If economic considerations become more important in formulating management policy, greater gains could be achieved by limiting effort than by altering mesh size regulations. However, as the management policy becomes less restrictive of effort, the influence of mesh size on fishery output increases.",
