  "title": "A Fish Population Study of Third Sister Lake",
  "abstract": "The fish population of Third Sister Lake was removed by angling, netting and poison (rotenone). Fish were recovered after poisoning by intensive hand picking. An unknown number of fish, particularly those of the smaller sizes, did not come to the surface when killed by the poison and were therefore not recovered or included in the population analysis. A total of 15,454 fish weighing 866.6 pounds was recovered from all operations or 86.6 pounds per acre. Bluegills of legal length accounted for about 50 pounds per acre. Legal game fish made up approximately 70 per cent of the total weight of all fish. In 80 man-hours of hook and line fishing during the 22 days prior to poisoning, 431 fish weighing 153 pounds were captured. Approximately one fourth of the total number of legal largemouth bass and bluegills in the lake were removed by this angling effort which equaled 4.6 fish per hour. Coarse fish made up 16.3 per cent and forage fish 3.4 per cent of the weight of all fish.",
