  "title": "Strengths of Indirect Effects Generated by Optimal Foraging",
  "abstract": "Models of a three-species food chain are used to explore the strengths of the indirect effects between the chain's top and bottom species caused by adaptive foraging by the middle species. Foraging effort by the middle species is adjusted based on the benefits (primarily reproduction) of increased intake and the costs (primarily predation risk) of increased effort. This paper extends an earlier analysis of this question by : 1) deriving results for general rather than specific cost and benefit functions; and 2) exploring the effect of the adaptive forager's life history on the magnitude of indirect effects. Large indirect effects are more likely to be transmitted by iteroparous specieswith high survival and low reproductive rates than by semelparous species",
