  "title": "Risk evaluation and biological reference points for fisheries management",
  "abstract": "This volume contains 31 papers presented in three theme sessions by fisheries scientists from around the world at a Department of Fisheries and Oceans' workshop in 1991. Papers presented address the use, strengths and weaknesses of commonly-used biological reference points; methods for identifying and quantifying uncertainties associated with using various reference points; and alternative management strategies or suggested strategies for dealing with novel situations. Answers to specific questions relating to fisheries management, compiled by four working groups at the workshop, are included, as well as a list of participants.",
