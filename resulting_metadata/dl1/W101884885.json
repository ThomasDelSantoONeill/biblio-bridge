  "title": "The California Rockfish Conservation Area and Groundfish Trawlers at Moss Landing Harbor",
  "abstract": "This article uses a bioeconomic model and data for groundfish trawlers at Moss Landing Harbor in Central California to analyze effects of spatial closures that were implemented recently by West Coast fishery managers to reduce bycatch of overfished groundfish stocks. The model has a dynamic linear rational expectations structure, and estimates of its parameters exhibit spatial variation in microeconomic and ecological factors that affect decisions about where and when to fish. Test results show that variation in marginal costs of crowding externalities and biological rates of stock productivity are the most significant factors to consider in the spatial management of groundfish trawlers at Moss Landing.",
