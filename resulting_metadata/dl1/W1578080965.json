  "title": "Biocomplexity Blooms in NSF's Research Garden",
  "abstract": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) has announced a $50 million competition for interdisciplinary proposals better understand and model complexity in biological, physical, and social systems. Combined with a pending request for funds to build 10 high-tech ecological observatories, the initiatives reflect an aggressive effort by NSF director Rita Colwell to promote research on biocomplexity in the environment. Her campaign will be strengthened next month with the arrival of paleoceanographer Margaret Leinen of the University of Rhode Island as NSF9s first environmental czar (see sidebar).",
