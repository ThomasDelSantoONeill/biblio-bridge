  "title": "Integrated Coastal and Ocean Management: Concepts And Practices",
  "abstract": "The intent of this publication is to present an account of the concept of integrated coastal and ocean management (ICM) and to illustrate how it can be accomplished by describing ways in which particular nations or their subnational governments (provinces, localities) have implemented various aspects of it. The major goals of the book are to provide the following: (1)a synthesis and analysis of international prescriptions for ICM; (2) a presentation of the major concepts and methodologies of ICM; (3) a practical guide to the establishment, implementation, and operation of ICM programs; (4) an analysis of different patterns of ICM followed in different countries; and (5) prescriptions for approaches that seem to be most successful, based on experience, a cross-national survey, which was conducted, and the scholarly literature in the field.",
