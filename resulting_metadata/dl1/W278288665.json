  "title": "The Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries",
  "abstract": "This chapter focuses on one of the most widespread, even ubiquitous, mechanisms advocated to improve fishery management â€“ the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) and the closely related concept of ecosystem-based management (EBM). A broad view of EBM/EA also fits well with applications to other sectors, such as urban management, drylands, forestry, and human health. EBM/EA should always incorporate 'the need for sound science, adaptation to changing conditions, partnerships with diverse stakeholders and organizations, and a long-term commitment to the welfare of both ecosystem and human societies'. EAF has been widely accepted in the fishery sector as a key vehicle for developing and improving fisheries management. In the discussion of entry points for EAF implementation, it is clear that human dimensions are involved in each of inducing, influencing, and supporting EAF. The chapter reviews how social, cultural, economic, political, legal, and institutional dimensions appear in an ecosystem approach.",
