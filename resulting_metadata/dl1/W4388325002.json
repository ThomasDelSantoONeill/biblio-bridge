  "title": "Indirect effects arising from optimal foraging",
  "abstract": "Abstract When an ecologist views a natural community, the interactions occurring between species are often invisible, especially those between mobile animal species. When he or she decides to carry out studies to try to understand the community, the interactions studied are therefore not necessarily the most obvious or the ones that are most important in determining community structure. Instead, they are usually interactions that have been studied by other ecologists recently, or are commonly discussed in textbooks or journals. The type of indirect interactions generated by behaviour have thus far received little attention, and their importance in natural communities is still largely unknown. If such behavioural indirect interactions are common and large in magnitude, this lack of knowledge may have something to do with ecologistsâ€™ conspicuous inability to predict the effects of perturbations on natural communities. Most previous discussions of indirect interactions have focused on interactions between species which occur because of changes in the population density of a third species, caused by direct interactions with the third species (Bender et al. 1984; Yodzis I 988; Schoener, Chapter 23 this volume).",
