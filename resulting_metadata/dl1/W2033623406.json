  "title": "Gross Photosynthesis as an Estimator of Potential Fish Production",
  "abstract": "Fish yield and gross photosynthesis were highly correlated in six ecosystems. Gross photosynthesis of phytoplankton and attached plants was measured as diel oxygen changes in unconfined water. Fish yield was measured by capture of all fish at the end of the experiments. Fish yield as live weight ranged from 0.54 to 2.48% of gross photosynthesis. The range of percentages was attributed to differences in foods used and to differences in stocking densities. Species of fish were rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), goldfish (Carassius auratus), and tilapia hybrids (Tilapia mossambica x Tilapia hornorum).",
