  "title": "On the Computation of Fixed Points in the Product Space of Unit Simplices and an Application to Noncooperative <i>N</i> Person Games",
  "abstract": "In this paper an algorithm based on the principle of simplicial approximation is introduced to compute fixed points of upper semicontinuous point to set mappings from the product space S of unit simplices into itself. The algorithm is a modification of an algorithm, introduced in an earlier paper. The main feature is that it starts with an arbitrary chosen point in S and that the triangulation of S depends on the starting point. Moreover, the algorithm can terminate with a non-full-dimensional subsimplex, yielding a good approximation. An application is given for non cooperative n person games, where S is the strategy space. Some computational experiences are given.",
