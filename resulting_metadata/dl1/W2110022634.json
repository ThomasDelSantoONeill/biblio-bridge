  "title": "A Method for Estimating the Potential Fish Production of North-temperate Lakes",
  "abstract": "Fish production (yield) is affected by three principal influences; the morphometric, edaphic, and climatic factors. Partial exclusion of the climatic factors reduces the complexity of the relationship of fish production and the other parameters. In this study of north-temperate lakes, the variability of the climatic factor is reduced to a minimum, and permits regression analyses of fish production on the morphometric and edaphic factors alone. Thirty-four north-temperate lakes were segregated into two groups; 23 lakes were moderately to intensively fished; 11 lakes had restricted catches or incomplete records. All 34 lakes satisfied criteria of area, altitude, and climate. Regression of fish production on the \"morphoedaphic\" index for each group of lakes was highly significant. The morphoedaphic index, an expression of mean depth and total dissolved solids, provided a means for estimating the potential productivity of a north-temperate lake.",
