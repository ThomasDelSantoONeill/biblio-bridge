We used nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N) as an index of the trophic level in a benthic fish and invertebrate size-spectrum, and demonstrated that body mass was positively and significantly related to trophic level. This pattern was consistent with the expectation that predator-prey relationships led to powerful size-based trophic structuring in marine communities and ecosystems. Further analysis of intra- and interspecific relationships between body mass and trophic level in the community showed that increases in trophic level across the size spectrum were predominantly a consequence of intra-specific increases in trophic level with body mass and not a consequence of larger species (species with greater maximum body mass) feeding at higher trophic levels. We confirmed the absence of strong inter-specific relationships between maximum body mass and trophic level with cross-species and phylogenetic comparative approaches. Size-based models are easier and cheaper to parameterise than most food-web models. Subject to the persistence of relationships between body mass and trophic level in space and time, our results suggest that size spectra could be parameterised with body mass-trophic level relationships and used to describe the trophic structure of some marine communities and ecosystems.
