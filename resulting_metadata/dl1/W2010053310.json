  "title": "Towards the Sustainable Corporation: Win-Win-Win Business Strategies for Sustainable Development",
  "abstract": "From the sustainable development policies of far-sighted governments to the increasing environmental awareness—and cynicism—of consumers, a range of pressures is being brought to bear on business to improve its environmental performance. This article traces the development of some of those pressures, highlighting industries in the firing line, and examining some of the concerns of consumers. It looks at the ways in which companies can turn the environment game into one in which they, their customers, and the environment are all winners. It also explores the rapidly expanding area of corporate environmental reporting, including forms of environmental disclosure, target audiences, and leading exponents of the field.",
