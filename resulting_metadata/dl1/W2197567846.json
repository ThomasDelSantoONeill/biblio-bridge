  "title": "Changing recruitment capacity in global fish stocks",
  "abstract": "Significance Marine fish stocks play an important role in marine ecosystems and provide a source of protein for billions of people worldwide. Recent environmental changes have affected the distribution of many stocks, but it is yet unclear whether their productivity is affected as well. We show that recruitment capacity (the ability of stocks to produce surviving offspring) has been significantly altered by both environmental changes and biological changes brought about by overfishing. In total, these effects have reduced recruitment capacity by 3% of the historical maximum per decade, on average. This paper helps us to understand and track previously unrecognized changes in fish stock productivity during the early stages of their life cycle.",
