  "title": "Integrating marine protected areas with catch regulation",
  "abstract": "Previous models of marine protected areas (MPAs) have generally assumed that there were no existing regulations on catch and have frequently shown that MPAs, by themselves, can be used to maintain both sustainable fish stocks and sustainable harvests. We explore the impact of implementing an MPA in a spatially structured model of a single-species fish stock that is regulated by total allowable catch (TAC). We find that when a stock is managed at maximum sustainable yield, or is overfished, implementation of an MPA will require a reduction in TAC to avoid increased fishing pressure on the stock outside the MPA. In both cases, catches will be lower as a result of overlaying an MPA on existing fisheries management. Only when the stock is so overfished that it is headed towards extinction does an MPA not lead to lower catches. In a TAC-regulated fishery, even if the stock is overfished, MPA implementation may not improve overall stock abundance or increase harvest unless catch is simultaneously reduced in the areas outside the MPA. Models that consider differential adult and larval dispersal need to be explored to see if these results are found with the more complex biology of a two-stage model.",
