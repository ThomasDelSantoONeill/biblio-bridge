  "title": "THE WARM AND THE COLD: INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND FISHING ON LOCAL POPULATION DYNAMICS OF RED ABALONE",
  "abstract": "We developed an individual-based, spatially explicit population-dynamics model to explore the effects of temperature, fishing pressure, and reserve size on red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) populations at two of the northern Channel Islands off the coast of California. The model locations represent the “warm” Santa Cruz Island, which has a fishing history of declining abalone stocks, and the “cold” San Miguel Island, which has a history of stable catches. We investigated the effects of three temperature scenarios for 100-year periods on the behavior of each population. In the first scenario we used the real temperature environment (sea surface temperature, SST) from the last 100 years; results showed a decline in both model populations over the last 20 years, with and without fishing. In the second scenario model runs using an SST time series generated from current conditions at the islands showed that in the absence of larval connectivity the warm population would go extinct within 75 years regardless of fishing level. The final SST scenario involved a range of constant, potential SSTs that could occur in the future; abalone populations persisted when the SST was between 11˚C and 16˚C. The influence of temperature on the model populations and the latitudinal range of suitable SST suggest a northward migration of the real red abalone range as SST increases over the next 100 years. Efforts to rebuild or protect populations for the future should consider which West Coast regions would provide suitable red abalone habitat given rising ocean temperatures.",
