  "title": "Can We Manage Our Atlantic Coastal Fishery Resources?",
  "abstract": "A fresh approach to coastal fisheries problems is needed; one including more biological and educational work and investigation of economic, social, and political factors which are potent influences in the interaction of fisheries resources and man. The conventional approach, by methods designed to foster management for optimum sustained yield for each important species, holds little promise for management of migratory fishes in inshore waters of the Atlantic coast. More consideration should be given to management of the biomass of the entire resource. Some statistics of the Atlantic coast fisheries are given and promising approaches for bettering management discussed.",
