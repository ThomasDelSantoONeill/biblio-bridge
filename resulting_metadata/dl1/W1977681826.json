  "title": "Entrapment and escape from fruitless insecticide use: lessons from the banana sector of Costa Rica",
  "abstract": "This article analyzes the consequences and causes of the \"pesticide treadmill\"—i.e. the cycle of resistance and secondary pest resurgence—from heavy use of insecticides in banana plantations of Costa Rica. It summarizes the background of intensive pesticide use in the large‐scale banana production, the consequent agroecological upsets, and the economic losses from this problem. In the examination of the causes, it is argued that the main contributing factors are not only biological factors (such as genetic selection) and technical factors (such as the high amounts used and the methods of application), but most importantly, are economic and social forces which determine the ways that pesticides are used. In the final section, lessons and policy implications are drawn, suggesting the need to implement major changes and to address the underlying roots of the pesticide‐use problems to achieve sustainable forms of agricultural development.",
