  "title": "Optimization problems in congestion control",
  "abstract": "One of the crucial elements in the Internet's success is its ability to adequately control congestion. The paper defines and solves several optimization problems related to Internet congestion control, as a step toward understanding the virtues of the TCP congestion control algorithm currently used and comparing it with alternative algorithms. We focus on regulating the rate of a single unicast flow when the bandwidth available to it is unknown and may change over time. We determine near-optimal policies when the available bandwidth is unchanging, and near-optimal competitive policies when the available bandwidth is changing in a restricted manner under the control of an adversary.",
