  "title": "MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF GROWTH OF MIXED POPULATIONS",
  "abstract": "It has been said occasionally that the attempt to apply mathematical reasoning to the phenomena of population growth is “futile” or worse; because, it is alleged, the phenomena are too complex to be amenable to mathematical description. It will be well, I think, to begin by admitting the truth of this allegation. In fact, I am inclined to the belief that one way to realize the complexity of the problem, and perhaps the best way, is to make a serious effort to set up equations for population growth. Such an effort will bring a realization of the number of factors, and of the ignorance we are in as to many of them, such as should completely satisfy the anti-mathematician.",
