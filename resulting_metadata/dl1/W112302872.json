  "title": "Solomon Islands and Vanuatu: an economic survey",
  "abstract": "Roderick Duncan is a Lecturer in the School of Marketing and Management at Charles Sturt University Governance strengthening programs such as the RAMSI in Solomon Islands and CRP in Vanuatu have achieved major overhauls of public service institutions, but the responses in terms of economic growth and human welfare indicators have been poor. Growth prospects post-RAMSI in Solomon Islands and post-CRP in Vanuatu are hindered because they are still high-cost economic environments for foreign investors.",
