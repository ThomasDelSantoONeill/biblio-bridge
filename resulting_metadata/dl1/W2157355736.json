  "title": "The System of Land Rights in Nigerian Agriculture",
  "abstract": "A bstract . Land ownership in the agricultural sector of the Nigerian economy is basically communal. Under this system the land holding group is the family, clan, village or community. An important practice under communal ownership is the principle of inalienability of land. The mobility of the agricultural labor force is inhibited. Non‐provincials are forbidden to plant cash crops. Property rights to land are not specific. Individualized allotments are absent and land markets non‐existent. Other details of the communal system of land tenure in Nigeria are given. Reasons are sought for the persistence of custom in the practice of inalienability of land even when economic conditions have changed, enabling the right perception of land values.",
