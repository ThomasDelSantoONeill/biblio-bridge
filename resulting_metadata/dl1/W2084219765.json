  "title": "Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Development",
  "abstract": "This volume contains selected papers from a series of workshops jointly sponsored by the World Bank and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The main objective of the workshops was to ascertain whether environmental accounting could be developed as a public policy tool, based on the present state of the art. In general, the papers selected for inclusion in this volume indicate current thinking on the issue of environmental and resource accounting. The various chapters reflect different aspects and approaches to environmental accounting. They are concerned mostly with financial and economic considerations and the prospects of modifying the U.N. System of National Accounts (SNA) to reflect issues of environmental and natural resource concern.",
