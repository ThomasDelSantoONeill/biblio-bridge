  "title": "Base case assessment of the South African sardine resource",
  "abstract": "Introduction The assessment of the South African sardine resource is in the process of being updated. This document outlines the base case assessment which has been updated from the last assessment (Cunningham and Butterworth 2004) to take account of new data: i) an update in the time series of November spawner biomass and May recruitment estimates from acoustic surveys, such that the new time series reflects uncapped estimates of biomass based on new target strength calculations, ii) new data for 2004 to 2006, iii) proportion-at-age data from the November spawner biomass surveys for years for which revised ALKs are available (see Durholtz and Cunningham 2007) (previously proportions-atage in the November surveys estimated using ALKs from Michael Kerstan for 1988 to 1999 were used), iv) proportion-at-length data from the November spawner biomass surveys for years for which ALKs are not available (see Durholtz and Cunningham 2007) v) quarterly proportion-at-length data from the commercial catches (previously annual catch-atage data, derived using ALKs from Michael Kerstan prior to 1999 and an ‘average’ ALK from 2000 to 2003, was assumed observed without error) In addition, this assessment has been updated from previous assessments to include: vi) a plus group of age 5 (previously sardine were assumed to spawn at age 5 and then die), vii) catch now assumed to be taken in a pulse mid-way between each quarter November-January, February-April, May-July, August-October (previously assumed to be taken on 1 May). viii) an estimate of length-at-age using a von-Bertananffy growth curve, estimated at 5 stages during the year: 1 November for calculating predicted proportions-at-length in the November survey, and mid-point of each quarter for calculating predicted proportions-at-length in the commercial catch, ix) an allowance for a difference in the growth rate between 2000 and 2004 (years of peak sardine abundance) in the von-Bertalanffy growth curves and in the mean weights-at-age in the November survey.",
