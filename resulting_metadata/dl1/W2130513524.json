  "title": "Pattern and Waves for a Model in Population Dynamics with Nonlocal Consumption of Resources",
  "abstract": "We study a reaction-diffusion equation with an integral term describing nonlocal consumption of resources in population dynamics. We show that a homogeneous equilibrium can lose its stability resulting in appearance of stationary spatial structures. They can be related to the emergence of biological species due to the intra-specific competition and random mutations. Various types of travelling waves are observed.",
