  "title": "Ecosystem approach to fisheries in the European context - history and future challenges",
  "abstract": "The ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) is currently a highly topical issue which, in the context of fisheries management, has been controversially discussed during the last decade. The aim of the current analysis was to reveal the historical development of the EAF and put it into perspective of its potential benefits and pitfalls. Current fisheries management approaches of the European Commission and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to implement an EAF are critically analysed. Shortcomings preventing a successful implementation of an EAF could be thereby identified on all levels, reaching from missing basic knowledge to an insufficient amount of data and questionable management concepts. Ideas how to overcome these shortcomings are discussed and some alternatives to currently planned measures to achieve a sustainable exploitation of fish stocks inside an EAF are suggested. It could be demonstrated that the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) concept in its current form is not suitable to reach the various objectives of an EAF. It is discussed how this concept can be changed to meet the various objectives.",
