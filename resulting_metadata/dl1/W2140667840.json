  "title": "Sucessional Status and the Palatability of Plants to Generalized Herbivores",
  "abstract": "Theoretical considerations and evidence from the literature suggest that early successional plant species should make a lesser commitment of resources to defense against herbivores, and should then provide better food sources for generalized herbivores than later successional and climax plants. Commitment to defense by plants is estimated by determining shortâ€”term palatabilities to two slug species; one native to western Washington, Ariolimax columbianus, and one introduced from Europe, Arion ater. Results of tests with 100 plant species of three growth forms and from different seral stages indicated that early successional annuals were significantly more palatable than early successional perennials which were significantly more palatable than later successional species. No correlation was found between palatability and evolutionary association of the herbivores with the plant species.",
