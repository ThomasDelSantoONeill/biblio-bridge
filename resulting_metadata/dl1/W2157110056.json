  "title": "Comparison of size-at-age of larval Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>) from different populations based on size- and temperature-dependent growth models",
  "abstract": "This study presents the first intraspecific evaluation of larval growth performance across several different experimental scales, environments, and regions of a marine fish species. Size- and temperature-dependent growth models for larval and early juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are developed based on selected laboratory experiments with cod fed in excess. Observed sizes-at-age of cod from several experiments and stocks are compared with predictions from the models using initial size and ambient temperature history as inputs. Comparisons with results from other laboratory experiments reveal that the model predictions represent relatively high growth rates. Results from enclosure experiments under controlled seminatural conditions generally provide growth rates similar to those predicted from the models. The models therefore produce suitable reference growth predictions against which field-based growth estimates can be compared. These comparisons suggest that surviving cod larvae in the sea typically grow at rates close to their size- and temperature-dependent capacity. This suggests that climatic influences will strongly affect the year-to-year variations in growth of cod during their early life history owing to their markedly temperature-dependent growth potential.",
