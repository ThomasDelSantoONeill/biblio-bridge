  "title": "Associational Plant Defenses and the Maintenance of Species Diversity: Turning Competitors Into Accomplices",
  "abstract": "The palatable plants investigated in this study gained significant protection from herbivores by associating with abundant competitors that were less susceptible to herbivory. When herbivores were excluded, palatable species associated with unpalatable ones grew at only 14%-19% of the rate of palatable plants separated from unpalatable ones. When herbivores were present, however, palatable species appeared to depend completely on unpalatable competitors to provide microsites of reduced herbivory to prevent grazers from causing local extinction of the preferred species. For the species studied here, the cost of being associated with a larger, unpalatable competitor was much less than the cost of increased consumption in the absence of that competitor. Under these conditions, one competitor can have a strong positive effect on another. Associational defenses can provide an unappreciated mechanism for maintaining species richness within communities that are dominated by one or a few major species. In this community, increases in the abundance of common late-successional competitors led to increases, not decreases, in the abundance and number of other species and to retention, not exclusion, of early-successional species.",
