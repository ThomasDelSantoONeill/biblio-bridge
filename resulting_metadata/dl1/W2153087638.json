  "title": "Bringing integrated ecosystem assessments to real life: a scientific framework for ICES",
  "abstract": "Abstract An ecosystem approach to management (EAM) aims to secure a healthy ecosystem along with sustainable use of its goods and services. Although the main principles of EAM are agreed upon and desirable, wider implementation of EAM is still a challenge. The difficulties stem from unclear definition and communication of the EAM, lack of routines or protocols to develop ecosystem-based advice, inappropriate institutional structures, and communication issues between scientists, advisers, and managers. Integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA) is an instrument that has proven to help in the implementation of EAM. For successful implementation of EAM and IEA in the European regional seas context, an international forum is required that develops tailor-made EAM tools specific to the different regional ecosystems to overcome fragmented national strategies. We describe a multinational peer network of working groups developed within the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) under the auspice of Science Steering Group on Regional Sea Programmes. Available is a wealth of data, expertise, scientific methods, and models for each regional sea. This network can be instrumental in advancing IEA for the implementation of EAM in the North Atlantic seas.",
