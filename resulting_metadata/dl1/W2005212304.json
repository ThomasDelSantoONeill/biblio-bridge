  "title": "Exploitation in a Type of Predator–Prey Relationship",
  "abstract": "The properties are explored of the response to exploitation of the predator–prey system defined by the equations:[Formula: see text]This type of equation is perhaps a suitable representation of the type of natural situation in which a predator (N 2 ) is not wholly dependent on one species of prey (N 1 ) for food, and in which factors other than predators may regulate prey abundance. Yield- and value-isopleths are presented for sample values of the above parameters and for various rates of fishing.",
