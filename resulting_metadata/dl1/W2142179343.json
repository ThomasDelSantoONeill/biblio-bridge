  "title": "Optimal Exploitation of Multiple Stocks by a Common Fishery: A New Methodology",
  "abstract": "Optimal harvest rates for mixed stocks of fish are calculated using stochastic dynamic programming. This technique is shown to be superior to the best methods currently described in the literature. The Ricker stock recruitment curve is assumed for two stocks harvested by the same fishery. The optimal harvest rates are calculated as a function of the size of each stock, for a series of possible parameter values. The dynamic programming solution is similar to the fixed escapement policy only when the two stocks have similar Ricker parameters, or when the two stocks are of equal size. Normally, one should harvest harder than calculated from fixed escapement analysis.",
