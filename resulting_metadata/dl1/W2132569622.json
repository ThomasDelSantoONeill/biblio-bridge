  "title": "Western Africa: A Fish Basket of Europe Past and Present",
  "abstract": "This article shows that despite increasing catches by foreign fishing fleets, the economic growth and social benefits from marine resources have not been met for many western African countries that host these fleets. A meta-analysis of changes in catches, market values, exports, imports, employment, access, and domestic supplies in western Africa since 1960 illustrates the impact of the expansion of distant-water fleets on not only the status of the marine resources and their ecosystems but also on the economic and social conditions of the people of western Africa. Finally, recommendations are made on appropriate management options for foreign fishing fleets and the key initiatives that could be considered by regional fish bodies and governments in western Africa.",
