  "title": "Biomass Spectra of Aquatic Ecosystems in Relation to Fisheries Yield",
  "abstract": "The biomass density of aquatic ecosystems can be expressed as an allometric function of organism body size. The logâ€“log plot of this relation, termed the biomass spectrum, is used to compare aquatic ecosystems in various parts of the world. We develop a standardized presentation for several example environments where detailed data on biomass density by body size in the trophic positions, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, and fish, make it possible to establish overall or primary spectral slopes. The basic methodology is adapted for application to other ecosystems where less detailed data are available. Spectra from all the different environments exhibit a uniform low slope, but with different intercepts that appear to reflect ecosystem differences in nutrient circulation and availability. Detail on the secondary structuring at various positions in the trophic system appears to provide information useful for distinguishing between long-term changes in productivity and short-term perturbations in biomass or abundance.",
