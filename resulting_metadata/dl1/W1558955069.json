  "title": "TCP/IP Sockets in C: Practical Guide for Programmers",
  "abstract": "Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. TCP/IP Sockets in Java: Practical Guide for Programmers, with its focused, tutorial-based coverage, helps you master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Later chapters teach you to implement more specialized functionality; incisive discussions of programming constructs and protocol implementations equip you with a deeper understanding that is invaluable for meeting future challenges. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the exact material you need to get up and running with Java sockets programming.",
