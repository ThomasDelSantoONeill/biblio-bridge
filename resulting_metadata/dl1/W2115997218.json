  "title": "An ecosystem-based approach for Alaska groundfish fisheries",
  "abstract": "An ecosystem-based approach is being developed for the management of groundfish fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean off Alaska, USA. The approach involves public participation, reliance on scientific research and advice, conservative catch quotas, comprehensive monitoring and enforcement, by-catch controls, gear restrictions, temporal and spatial distribution of fisheries, habitat conservation areas, and other biological and socioeconomic considerations. The basic ecosystem consideration employed is a precautionary approach to extraction of fish resources. Off Alaska, all groundfish stocks are considered healthy, while providing sustained yields of about 2 million tonnes annually. Management measures are also taken to minimize potential impacts of fishing on seafloor habitat and other ecosystem components such as marine mammals and seabirds.",
