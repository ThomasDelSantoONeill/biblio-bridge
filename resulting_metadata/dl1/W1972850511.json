  "title": "Data-poor management of African lion hunting using a relative index of abundance",
  "abstract": "Significance Trophy hunting is a useful source of income for conservation. However, it remains contentious, not least because quotas for charismatic species in less-developed countries are often too high, contributing to population decline. The decline of lion populations across Africa continues and is not helped by the unsustainable management of hunting concessions. Best practice rests on the enforcement of a minimum age rule for hunting of males, which allows them to breed before they are killed. However, there is still no reliable method for setting quotas at a sustainable level. In this paper, we present such a method, which makes use of readily available data on the time needed to find and kill a lion, and demonstrate its efficacy through simulation.",
