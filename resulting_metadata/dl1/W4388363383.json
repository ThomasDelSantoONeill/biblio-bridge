  "abstract": "Abstract Diversity can be quantified in many ways (Gaston 1994). Food webs are one representation of diversity which explicitly incorporates both taxonomic and functional aspects of community structure. Webs may be represented as binary structures, with links simply present or absent, or as ‘functional webs’ including information about energy flow or other measures of interaction strength. Most comparative analyses of food webs have utilised the former (e.g. Cohen 1978, Briand 1983, Pimm 1982, Pimm et al. 1991, Schoenly et al. 1991, Martinez 1992, Bengtsson, 1994; though see also Hairston and Hairston 1993). Such data define the trophic ‘scaffolding’ of a community, representing interactions that are possible, or simply those that are most frequent (depending on the resolution of the data). Although just looking at the scaffolding provides limited information about the functional significance of each link, existence is a prerequisite for importance, and a connectance web defines the bounds of structure within which functionally important links must lie. Additionally, many of the factors determining the occurrence of a link will also be important in determining its strength (e.g. relative body size of predator and prey may both set limits to, and influence the frequency of, prey capture (e.g. Werner and Hall 1974, Kislalioglu and Gibson 1976)).",
