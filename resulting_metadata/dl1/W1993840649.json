  "title": "Competition Between Aquatic Insects and Vertebrates: Interaction Strength and Higher Order Interactions",
  "abstract": "Replicated experiments in artificial ponds demonstrated that an assemblage of aquatic insects competed with tadpoles of the frogs Hyla andersonii and Bufo woodhousei fowleri. We independently manipulated the presence or absence of aquatic insects, and the abundance of an anuran competitor (O or 150 Bufo w. fowleri per experimental pond), using a completely crossed design for twoâ€”factor variance analysis, and observed the responses of initially similar cohorts of Hyla andersonii tadpoles to neither, either, or both insect and anuran competitors. Insects and Bufo significantly depressed the mean individual mass at metamorphosis of Hyla froglets and the cumulative biomass of anurans leaving the ponds at metamorphosis. Neither insects nor Bufo affected the survival or larval period of Hyla. Insects also significantly reduced the mean mass of Bufo, showing that both anurans responded to competition from insects. The intensity of competition between natural densities of insects and Hyla tadpoles was comparable to the intensity of competition between Bufo and Hyla, as a density of 150 Bufo/1000 L.",
