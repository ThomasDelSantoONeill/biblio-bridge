  "title": "Design of operational management strategies for achieving fishery ecosystem objectives",
  "abstract": "Ecosystem objectives in fisheries management usually flow from high-level national\r\npolicies or strategies and international agreements. Consequently they are often\r\nbroadly stated and hence are difficult to incorporate directly in management plans.\r\nPredicting the results of any management action is very uncertain because the\r\ndynamics of ecosystems are complex and poorly understood. Methods to design and\r\nevaluate operational management strategies have advanced considerably in the past\r\ndecade. These management-strategy-evaluation (MSE) methods rely on simulation\r\ntesting of the whole management process using performance measures derived from\r\noperational objectives. The MSE approach involves selecting (operational) management\r\nobjectives, specifying performance measures, specifying alternative management\r\nstrategies, and evaluating these using simulation. The MSE framework emphasizes the\r\nidentification and modelling of uncertainties, and propagates these through to their\r\neffects on the performance measures. The framework is outlined and illustrated by\r\nthree ecosystem-related applications: management of benthic habitats and broad fish\r\ncommunity composition; by-catch of species of high conservation value; and foodchain\r\ninteractions and dependencies. Challenges to be overcome before broader\r\necosystem-related objectives can be fully handled are discussed briefly.",
