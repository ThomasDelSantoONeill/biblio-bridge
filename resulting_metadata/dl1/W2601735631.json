  "title": "A new look at the relationship between diversity and stability",
  "abstract": "Abstract The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has emerged as one of the most exciting and controversial research areas in ecology over the last decade. Faced with the prospect of a massive, irreversible loss of biodiversity, ecologists have begun investigating the potential consequences of these dramatic changes in biodiversity for the functioning of natural and managed ecosystems. These investigations have been motivated by both the scientific challenge and the need to understand better the role biodiversity plays in providing sustainable ecological goods and services for human societies.",
