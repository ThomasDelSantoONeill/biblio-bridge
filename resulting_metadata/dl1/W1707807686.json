  "title": "The Price of Emancipation: Slave-Ownership, Compensation and British Society at the End of Slavery",
  "abstract": "When colonial slavery was abolished in 1833 the British government paid Â£20 million to slave-owners as compensation: the enslaved received nothing. Drawing on the records of the Commissioners of Slave Compensation, which represent a complete census of slave-ownership, this book for the first time provides a comprehensive analysis of the extent and importance of absentee slave-ownership and its impact on British society.",
