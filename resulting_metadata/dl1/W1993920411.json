  "title": "Ecosystem-based fisheries management: some practical suggestions",
  "abstract": "Globally, there is increased scientific and public interest in the concept of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). This trend is fueled by a widespread perception that large-scale fishing operations are powerful forces altering the structure and function of marine ecosystems. It is acknowledged that management needs to better account for variations in ocean productivity, stock structure, and changing social values. Many countries are contemplating how to improve ocean fishery management. In the United States, fishery management bodies are experiencing pressure to undertake the daunting task of moving from their current single-species management plans to EBFM. Impediments include lack of a clear definition of EBFM, what it entails, or how to proceed. In this paper, characteristics of fishery management that are unique to EBFM are identified. The transition to EBFM needs to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. A course of action is outlined that can be used to guide this transition. Modeling approaches and metrics useful for planning, implementing, and evaluating EBFM are discussed, with particular emphasis on management strategy evaluation.",
