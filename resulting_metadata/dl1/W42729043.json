  "title": "Goals, Agenda, and Policy Recommendations for Ecological Economics",
  "abstract": "Frontiers in Ecological Economics presents some of Robert Costanza's most important work on understanding ecological and economic systems. A signal contribution of Costanza's work is that he transcends disciplinary boundaries by collaborating closely with other specialists and thereby constructs an integrated analysis of the interaction between humans and the rest of the natural world. The book improves access to Robert Costanza's work which has made a fundamental contribution to the field of ecological economics.",
