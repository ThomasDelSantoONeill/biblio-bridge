  "title": "Effects of birds on sea urchins and algae: A lower-intertidal trophic cascade",
  "abstract": "Bird predators (glaucous-winged gulls [Larus glaucescens], American black oystercatchers [Haematopus bachmani], and northwestern crows [Corvus caurinus]) were excluded over a period of 2 years with large, wide-mesh cages in the lower intertidal zone of Tatoosh Island, Washington State, U.S.A. to determine their direct and indirect effects on sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) abundance and macro-algal abundance and diversity. Bird predation directly reduced urchin abundance by 45-59%. By reducing urchin grazing, birds indirectly increased algal cover 24-fold, and increased algal taxonomic richness 6-fold across all replicates. Path analysis further supported the hypothesis that birds indirectly affected algal cover via a trophic cascade, and indicated that variation in algal taxonomic richness was strongly affected by sea urchin effects on algal cover in a non-linear way, but was only weakly influenced by the independent effects of selective foraging by sea urchins. Taxonomic richness increased with increasing algal cover at low levels of algal cover, but in a diminishing fashion as algal cover increased, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The results indicate that trophic cascades are important in this lower intertidal community and that predators may indirectly affect the diversity of guilds at lower trophic levels by controlling the abundance of keystone consumers.",
