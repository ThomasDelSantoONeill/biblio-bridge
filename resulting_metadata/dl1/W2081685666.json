  "title": "Offshore spawning and year-class strength of northern cod (2J3KL) during the fishing moratorium, 1994-1996",
  "abstract": "Two new surveys have been conducted in recent years to assess the status of the northern cod (Gadus morhua) stock (2J3KL). An offshore acoustic survey in spring sampled concentrations of spawning adults and estimated potential fecundity. A pelagic juvenile fish survey carried out in late summer measured cod year-class strength prior to settlement. Spawning biomass of offshore cod decreased from 11 700 t in 1994 to 2000 t in 1995 to 900 t in 1996 with a corresponding decrease in eggs spawned. This decline was mirrored in the distribution and abundance of pelagic juvenile cod. Natural mortality estimated between the egg and pelagic juvenile stages increased from 0.068·day 1 in 1994 to 0.084·day 1 in 1995 to 0.112·day 1 in 1996. The decline in year-class strength of cod appeared to result primarily from a reduction in the number of offshore spawners compounded by an increase in natural mortality during the egg and larval stages. The decline in spawners occurred 2 years after the implementation of a fishing moratorium and cannot be linked to fishing. The rapid decline in abundance of adult fish combined with increased natural mortality during the egg and larval drift is consistent with depensation.",
