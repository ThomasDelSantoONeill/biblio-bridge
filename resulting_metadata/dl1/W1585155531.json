  "title": "The green national product: a proposed index of sustainable economic welfare",
  "abstract": "Many critics of mainstream economics have been calling for a new compass to guide national economic policies because the existing one, the GNP, is broken. They propose a 'green national product' which would address the long-term health of the planet and its inhabitants, and focus on sustainability. Toward this end, they propose an Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW), which takes into account such elements as adjustments for income distribution, environmental damage, the value of housework, and resource depletion. Experts in the field of economic development present comments and criticisms regarding the creation of the ISEW and its outcome. The book concludes with the authors' direct response to those critical suggestions, culminating with a revised Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare. Contributors: Robert Eisner, Alan H. Young, Carol S. Carson, Robert R. Gottfried, Thomas Michael Power, E.J. Mishan, Jan Tinbergen, Richard D. Lamm, and Hans Diefenbacher. Co-published with the Human Economy Center.",
