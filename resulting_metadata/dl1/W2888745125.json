  "abstract": "The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is an interconnected system of thousands of coral reefs and shoals spanning more than 2,000 km of the eastern Australian coastline.Anthropogenic pressures-principally climate change-pose an existential threat to this iconic marine ecosystem [1].Management actions are urgently required to halt and reverse the degradation, but the GBR's enormous size creates logistical and budgetary challenges.In a recent research article, Hock and colleagues [2] offer a solution to this predicament: They argue that a tiny fraction of the GBR's reefs-fewer than 1%-act as its 'life-support system ' [3].The reefs are primarily identified by their larval connectivity, the movement of juvenile individuals between reefs on ocean currents.A dispersive larval stage is common to many species on coral reefs-notably fishes and reef-building corals-and is an essential source of new recruits following mortality and disturbance.Unfortunately, because larvae are difficult and expensive to follow during their pelagic dispersal phase, empirical data are not available at management-relevant scales [4].Instead, Hock and colleagues base their decisions on 'biophysical models'-computer simulations that integrate individual-based models of larval behaviour with hydrodynamic ocean current models.In recent years, biophysical models have become a standard tool for investigating the effects of larval connectivity on marine ecology, evolution, and conservation [4][5][6].Because their biophysical model predicts that a small number of reefs contribute disproportionately to the GBR's persistence and resilience, Hock and colleagues claim that these reefs should be a primary focus of management resources.In this comment, we show that the identity of these reefs should be treated with caution, since different numerical models of larval connectivity select different reefs as priorities.More generally, we argue that the current generation of biophysical models should not be used to guide management actions at the scale of individual reefs.The last decade has seen rapid advances in the sophistication of biophysical models.Highperformance computing allows these models to simulate billions of larval releases across thousands of kilometres, while their biological components now incorporate experimentally measured sensory and swimming capabilities.However, despite these strengths, accurate numerical modelling of shallow coastal flow fields with highly variable bathymetry-conditions typical of coral reefs-remains an immense challenge.Critical near-reef hydrodynamics often vary at substantially smaller scales (1 m-1,000 m) than the resolution of biophysical models (100 m-10,000 m; [7]).Such difficulties are exacerbated by uncertainty about the parameters that describe larval development, behaviour, and mortality, as well as adult spawning behaviour [6].These limitations have been debated extensively [8]; given this level of uncertainty, we have strong reservations about whether existing biophysical models are",
