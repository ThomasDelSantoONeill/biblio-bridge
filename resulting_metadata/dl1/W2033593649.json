  "title": "DIRECT AND INVERSE SOLUTIONS OF GEODESICS ON THE ELLIPSOID WITH APPLICATION OF NESTED EQUATIONS",
  "abstract": "AbstractThis paper gives compact formulae for the direct and inverse solutions of geodesics of any length. Existing formulae have been recast for efficient programming to conserve space and reduce execution time. The main feature of the new formulae is the use of nested equations for elliptic terms. Both solutions are iterative.",
