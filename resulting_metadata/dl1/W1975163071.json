  "title": "Reflections on Solow's 1974 Richard T. Ely Address",
  "abstract": "lecture by noting that the ideal topic for a featured address must be contemporary but perennial.His topic, the economics of exhaustible resources, was front-page news when it engaged the great Harold Hotelling in the 1930s, highly topical again in the 1970s, and yet again in 2008.But Solow's staying power is not limited to choice of topic-after 35 years, the reader cannot help but admire the extent to which Solow achieved a contemporary but perennial analysis.Solow addressed five major aspects of the exhaustible resources problem, and I will start by conveying a little of the flavour of what he had to say about each, viewed from today's perspective.",
