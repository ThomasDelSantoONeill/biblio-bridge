  "title": "Biotic enrichment of intertidal sediments by experimental aggregates of the deposit-feeding bivalve Macoma balthica",
  "abstract": "Experimental aggregates of the bivalve Macoma balthica, established on a sandy tidal flat in the North Sea, are preferentially colonized by small zoobenthos.The tellinids stay buried at 3 to 6 cm while their long inhalant siphons pick up deposits from the surface.The short exhalant siphons terminate within the sediment.High abundance of diatom-feeding Turbellaria at the surface, and bacteria-feedmg and predatory species in the subsurface suggest enhanced growth of rnicroalgae, bacteria and their grazers, stimulated by M. balthica.No such 'gardening' effects are observed within aggregates of the suspension-feeding cockle Cerastoderma edule, where exhalant siphons are flush with the surface.Both bivalve aggregates, however, displaced the tube-dwelling polychaete Pygospjo elegans.",
