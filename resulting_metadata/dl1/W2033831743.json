  "title": "Direct Estimation of Competition",
  "abstract": "A regression method for estimating competition coefficients is presented. Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the model is robust and the central assumption of equilibrial populations may be violated within reason. Actual application to natural populations requires inclusion of habitat components as additional independent variables to account for habitat selection effects. Possible means of verifying the estimated coefficients are outlined. The regression approach requires fewer assumptions than commonly used methods based on resource overlap and should prove useful in studies of community structure and organization.",
