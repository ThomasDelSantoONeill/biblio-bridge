  "title": "THE BACKWARD‐BENDING SUPPLY CURVE OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY1",
  "abstract": "Proceeding from an article by Gordon, published in 1954, the substance of an economic theory of the fisheries has emerged from the writings of a number of economists. 2 The theory has emphasized the common‐ property nature of the fishery resource, generally leading to an ‘over‐exploitation’ that results in dissipation of the rent that the resource could yield.",
