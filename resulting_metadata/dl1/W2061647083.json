  "title": "The Rights of Nature: A History of Environmental Ethics",
  "abstract": "Charting the history of contemporary philosophical and religious beliefs regarding nature, Roderick Nash focuses primarily on changing attitudes toward nature in the United States. His work is the first comprehensive history of the concept that nature has rights and that American liberalism has, in effect, been extended to the nonhuman world. A splendid book. Roderick Nash has written another classic. This exploration of a new dimension in environmental ethics is both illuminating and overdue. Stewart Udall His account makes history come alive. Sierra So smoothly written that one almost does not notice the breadth of scholarship that went into this original and important work of environmental history. Philip Shabecoff, New York Times Book Review Clarifying and challenging, this is an essential text for deep ecologists and ecophilosophers. Stephanie Mills, Utne Reader",
