  "title": "Interdisciplinary Modeling for an Ecosystem Approach to Management in Marine Social‚ÄêEcological Systems",
  "abstract": "Interdisciplinary research to address global change is essential but inherently difficult. Modeling is a necessary component of many interdisciplinary projects; the way in which modelers approach their work and think about modeling can have a profound effect on the success of the project as a whole. This contribution discusses crucial considerations for interdisciplinary modeling: setting of clear system objectives generated from the interdisciplinary problem; identification of an appropriate level of resolution and its maintenance through all aspects of model design; selection of collaborators genuinely interested in interdisciplinarity while well-grounded in their disciplines; maintained focus on communication; rapid prototyping as an approach to develop the project as understanding increases; and choice of a modeling paradigm that focuses on objectives and leads to a balanced contribution from each discipline. Frame-based modeling is introduced as an example of a modeling paradigm suitable to address long-term changes in social-ecological systems.",
