  "title": "An Introduction to the EcoTroph R Package: Analyzing Aquatic Ecosystem Trophic Networks",
  "abstract": "Recent advances in aquatic ecosystem modelling have particularly focused on trophic network analysis through trophodynamic models.We present here a R package devoted to a recently developed model, EcoTroph.This model enables the analysis of aquatic ecological networks and the related impacts of fisheries.It was available through a plug-in in the well-known Ecopath with Ecosim software or through implementations in Excel sheets.The R package we developed simplifies the access to the EcoTroph model and offers a new interfacing between two widely used software, Ecopath and R.",
