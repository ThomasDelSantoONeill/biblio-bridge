  "title": "ALTERNATIVES TO RESILIENCE FOR MEASURING THE RESPONSES OF ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS TO PERTURBATIONS",
  "abstract": "Resilience is a component of ecological stability; it is assessed as the rate at which perturbations to a stable ecological system decay. The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to infinity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow significantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum amplification (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this amplification occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the flow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predatorâ€“prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation.",
