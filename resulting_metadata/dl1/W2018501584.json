  "title": "Population Dynamics of Exploited Fish Stocks at Low Population Levels",
  "abstract": "Models of population dynamics in which per capita reproductive success declines at low population levels (variously known as depensation, the Allee effect, and inverse density-dependence) predict that populations can have multiple equilibria and may suddenly shift from one equilibrium to another. If such depensatory dynamics exist, reduced mortality may be insufficient to allow recovery of a population after abundance has been severely reduced by harvesting. Estimates of spawner abundance and number of surviving progeny for 128 fish stocks indicated only 3 stocks with significant depensation. Estimates of the statistical power of the tests strengthen the conclusion that depensatory dynamics are not apparent for fish populations at the levels studied.",
