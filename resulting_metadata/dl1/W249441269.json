  "title": "CURRENT SITUATION, TRENDS AND PROSPECTS IN WORLD CAPTURE FISHERIES'",
  "abstract": "Following an earlier analysis provided by FAO (19931, the paper gives an update of the trends and future perspectives of world fisheries. It describes and comments on worldwide trends in landings, trade, prices and fleet size. It illustrates the decrease in landings in the last 3 years, the relationship between landings and prices and the large overcapacity in world fishing fleets. It provides a review of the state of world fishery resources, globally, by region and species groups, as well as a brief account of environmental impacts on fisheries. It presents an economic perspective for world fisheries which underlines further the overcapacity and subsidy issues that characterize modern fisheries. In conclusion, it discussesâ€˜management issues including the need for fleet reduction policies, the potential combined effect of international trade on resources depletion in developing exporting countries, throwing into question the overall sustainability of the world fishery system.",
