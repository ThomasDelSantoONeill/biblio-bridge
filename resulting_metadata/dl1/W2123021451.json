  "title": "Species diversity, functional diversity, and ecosystem functioning",
  "abstract": "Abstract Experiments assessing the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning initially aimed at establishing whether such relationships exist (e.g. Naeem et al. 1995; Tilman et al. 1996; Jonsson and Malmqvist 2000; Engelhardt and Ritchie 2001). These phenomenological studies were useful for helping to identify patterns and articulate further questions. However, using species richness as a simple mea sure of biotic diversity, as they did, had no explicit explanatory power: ecosystem level processes are affected by the functional characteristics of organ isms involved, rather than by taxonomic identity (Odum 1969; Pugh 1980; Grime 1988).",
