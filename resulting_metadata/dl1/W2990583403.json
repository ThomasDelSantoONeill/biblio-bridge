  "title": "Simulation models of the trophic cascade: predictions and evaluations",
  "abstract": "Previous chapters have detailed the responses of Peter and Tuesday Lakes to fish manipulations. Some of the changes were anticipated, while others were surprises. Our research was guided by models of the trophic cascade in lakes. To what extent did these models forecast the experimental results? The purpose of this chapter is to assess how our predictions fared, and how our view of the trophic cascade has been modified by the experimental outcome. First, we must explain why we developed simulation models of the trophic cascade, how the models were structured, and the predictions that derived from the models.",
