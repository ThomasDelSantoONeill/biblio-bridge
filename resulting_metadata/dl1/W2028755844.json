  "title": "Empirical Approach to Multispecies Stock Assessment",
  "abstract": "Abstract We developed a method for the analysis of observed changes in catch rates of similar species or groups of fish from southeastern Asia and the northwestern Atlantic region. Aggregated time series of catches per standard tow from research vessel surveys were examined as Markov chain models after transition probability matrices were derived from them by quadratic programming. The matrices were projected to provide some insight about stability and changes in the multispecies assemblages. Results from these analyses generally support inferences previously made from the data and provide some additional information regarding stability.",
