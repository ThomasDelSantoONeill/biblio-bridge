  "abstract": "The thematic assessment of pollinators, pollination\r\nand food production carried out under the auspices\r\nof the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on\r\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services aims to assess\r\nanimal pollination as a regulating ecosystem service\r\nunderpinning food production in the context of its\r\ncontribution to nature’s gifts to people and supporting\r\na good quality of life. To achieve this, it focuses\r\non the role of native and managed pollinators, the\r\nstatus and trends of pollinators and pollinator-plant\r\nnetworks and pollination, drivers of change, impacts\r\non human well-being, food production in response to\r\npollination declines and deficits and the effectiveness\r\nof responses.\r\n\r\nThe chapters and their executive summaries of this\r\nassessment are available as document IPBES/4/INF/1/Rev.2 (www.ipbes.net).
