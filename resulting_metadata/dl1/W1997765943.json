  "title": "Experimental Aquatic Food Webs: Interactions between Two Predators and Two Prey",
  "abstract": "We performed four replicates of all 16 combinations of the presence and absence of two predators (larvae of the dragonfly Anax junius and adult salamanders Notophthalmus viridescens) and two anuran prey (Bufo americanus and Rana palustris larvae) in an array of artificial temporary ponds. The two species of anurans were introduced at densities high enough to cause density-dependent reductions in survival and body size at metamorphosis and to increase larval period. The two species were in competition when raised together. Notophthalmus reduced the density of Bufo and caused the survivors to metamorphose early and at a small size. Anax caused an even greater reduction in survival but not as strong an acceleration of metamorphosis. Newts also reduced the density of Rana, but survivors benefited by growing rapidly. The effects of Anax were even stronger; the only Rana tadpoles that were able to metamorphose in the 2 mo of the experiment were from ponds in which Anax reduced densities enough to permit rapid growth of the surviving tadpoles.",
