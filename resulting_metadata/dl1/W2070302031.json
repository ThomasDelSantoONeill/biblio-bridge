  "title": "Maximum Sustainable Yield Lives On",
  "abstract": "I examined 142 papers published from 1977 through 1985 that used the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY). I classified them as to how MSY was used, year of publication, subject, and publication forum. The primary uses of MSY were in estimating long-term yield (28.9%), evaluating stock condition (28.2%), and analyzing policy (21.8%). The number of such publications declined significantly (P < 0.02) from 1977 to 1985, primarily because of decreased use of MSY in managing marine mammals. There was no significant decline (P > 0.05) in the application of MSY to fish or in policy analysis. The reasons for the continued use of MSY were varied but fell into two broad categories. First, it is a simple concept that is readily understood by the fishing industry, administrators, and managers. Second, it is used by management in attempting to predict the consequences of harvesting activities on fish populations. There seems to be no operational rival to MSY. Thus, from a mangement standpoint it is important to develop a protocol for using MSY in the decision-making process.",
